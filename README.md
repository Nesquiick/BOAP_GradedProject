"# BOAP_GradedProject" 

!This application was made by Lorele√Ø NOIRAUD (V4)!

For the Graded Exercise of Basic of android programming :
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I wanted at first to do a Habit tracker. After two weeks of trying to figure out how to
create a different view in the Java code I decided to finally do a "to do" list.
I still have the view of my only try that worked "old_activity_main.xml".
I was just setting the visibility of the concerned layout in VISIBLE, but there was a
limit of 7 habits tracked.

I learned a lot during this class. Thanks !
